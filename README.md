🧪 How to Use This Repo

Pick a topic

Solve the problem yourself first

Then compare with my approach

Note differences in logic, not just syntax

Re-implement without seeing the code

That’s how you actually improve.

⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions are for learning and revision.
Blindly memorizing code will not get you placed.
Understanding patterns will.
